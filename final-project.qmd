*Figure 2*: Estimated difference in treatment effect between full length follow-up period and a series of shortened follow-up periods, across CGM metric endpoints. 95% confidence intervals containing the red dashed line indicated a lack of significant difference. Estimates derived from linear mixed effects model.
